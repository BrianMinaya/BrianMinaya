### Professional Profile
Howdy, I'm Brian 👋

Senior Consultant at Deloitte within AI & Engineering, based out of Houston, TX. I spend my days working across Azure, AWS, and GCP, helping teams make sense of multi-cloud environments and navigate the technical side of things so nothing gets lost in translation.
My approach is pretty simple: meet people where they are, understand what the business actually needs, and make sure the architecture we put in place holds up when things get real. That usually means wearing a lot of hats, whether it's untangling complexity, scaling automation, or making sure observability is in place so teams aren't flying blind.
What I'm working with:

Multi-cloud architecture & governance (Azure, AWS, GCP)
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CI/CD pipelines)
Monitoring & observability (Datadog)
Automation (Python, Bash)
Security & compliance frameworks

What I'm exploring:

AI engineering and the intersection of cloud infrastructure + AI systems
Building projects that sit at that crossroads

I'm always down to connect with folks in the cloud, infrastructure, or AI space. Feel free to reach out.
